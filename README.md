# sophication
A command-line based flash card program written in python.  It is currently
a VERY rudimentary application; only handling multiplication flash cards.<br>
<br>
The sophication package is my sandbox project to learn packaging and typing for
python. I will add additional functionality after I have packaged and type the
simple one.  The application currently has a text-to-speech component, but I am
unsure if that will remain.<br>
